## Creating a 3D model
In order to 3D print an object you first need a "step" file. You can create these files using CAD software such as Fusion360 or Sketchup if you are a beginner.
Search on Youtube for tutorials on these pieces of software to learn more about 3D modeling.

## Printing your 3D model
Follow the following steps to print your model in the Innovation Lab
1. Start remote desktop 
<img src = "https://github.com/TDYInnovationLab/WorkInstructions/blob/main/READMESources/RemoteDesktopConnection.jpg" width="25%" height="25%">
2. Open up Bambu Studio on the remote PC
3. Select the "prepare" tab in Bambu Studio
4. Drag and drop the you .stl or 3mf file onto Bambu Studio. Your model should appear in Bambu Studio. If it gives error or warning messages on the bottom right as a pop up message DO NOT continou and fix your model first.
5. Select object
6. Click on the color to change the material you would like to use. Here is a small guide to see what you need:
- PLA-CF is a carbon fibre reinforced PLA. PLA strong but brittle and cannot handle temperatures above 80 degrees when it needs structural regidity.
- support W is a support material used to support overhang when printing PLA material. This support material will desolve in water.
- PETG-CF is a carbon fibre reinforced PETG. PETG is strong and a bit flexible when printing a thin part. It will be able to handle higher temperatures then PLA.
- Support G is a support material used to support overhang when printing PETG material. This support material will desolve in water.
7. When you would like to use a different material please requist this with an Email to InnovationLabTDY@teledyne.com 
8. Check if your print has a lot of overhang. This 3D printer will print by stacking layers on top of eachother. When the print head is not able to deposite material on top of something we call that overhang.
9. When you have overhang in your model go to the "support" tab and select "Enable support".
10. Click "slice plate" to let Bambu Studio create a file that will be understood by the 3D printer.
11. Now you will get a lot of details about your print and 2 sliders. 1 horizontal and 1 vertical slider. Play around with the vertical slider to see how the software has seperated your model in layers.
12. Press "Print plate"
13. deselect the timelapse feature and press "print".
14. Wait until your print is ready.
15. When the screen says completed remove your print by taking the print surface out of the printer and slightly bending it. Your print should pop right off.
